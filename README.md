# **scCURE**<br>
* A Gaussian mixture model based single-cell RNA-seq data analysis algorithm.<br>

# **Code Preparation**<br>
* Download the scCURE.m for running scCURE.<br>
* Five dependent function are required and need to download from this page including DEG.m, OGFSC.m, estimateK.m, mvgkl.m, readdata.m.<br>
* It should be ensured that all .m files are in the same work path.<br>

# **Run scCURE**<br>
We can start using scCURE by running the demo data which downloads from the release called 'demo-originaldata'.
